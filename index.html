        <blockquote class="italic" cite="https://wellsbaum.blog/2018/01/27/alan-watts-the-story-of-the-chinese-farmer/">
            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>
            <p class="villagers">They said, <span class="villagercol">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. </span>This is most unfortunate.”</p>
            <p class="farmer">The farmer said, <strong><span class="farmercol">“Maybe.”</span></strong></p>
            <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p> 
            <p class="villagers"><span class="villagercol">“Oh, isn’t that lucky.</span> What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</p>
            <p class="farmer">The farmer again said,<strong><span class="farmercol">“Maybe.”</span></strong></p>
            <p class="bad">The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. 
            <p class="villagers">The neighbors then said,<span class="villagercol">“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,”</span></p>
            <p class="farmer">and the farmer responded,<strong><span class="farmercol">“Maybe.”</span></strong> </p>
            <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. 
            <p class="villagers">Again all the neighbors came around and said,<span class="villagercol">“Isn’t that great!”</span></p>
            <p class="farmer">Again, he said,<strong><span class="farmercol">“Maybe.”</span></strong></p>

        <q class="posandcons italic">The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</q>

        <h2>Conclusion </h2>
        <p class="posandcons"><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
